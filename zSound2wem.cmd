::----------------------------------------::
:: [User Section]
:: This script is used to convert audio files (.mp3, .wav, ...) to Wwise Vorbis audio (.wem).
:: By default, this script uses the folder it's placed in! It is not recommended to run it directly from Desktop.
:: To uninstall, simply unistall Wwise, delete the generated conversion project folder, (optional) delete folder containing ffmpeg, and finally delete the script.

:: Requirements: Wwise, FFmpeg
:: IF the requirements are not met, this script will guide you along an installation (so run it anyways).
:: 		Wwise will need to be installed manually, by creating an account on Audiokinetic's site.
:: 		FFmpeg will be automatically installed in the current directory (will not be saved in path).
:: 		To unzip FFmpeg, the script will also temporarily install 7-zip (then remove it), if it's not found in path or its typical locations.
:: (Options will work by default, so only bother with them when you need to)
:: Usage and installation meant for 64-bit computers.

:: [Usage]
:: Choose one of the following
:: [1] Drag n' drop your audio files onto the script. (With drag n' drop, batch has a seizure. See [?4])
:: [2] Run the script with command line arguments consisting of your audio file names.

:: [Tips]
:: I use foobar2000 with the vgmstream extension to play Wwise sound bank (.bnk) audio.
:: Then I convert the desired replacement audio using this script.
:: Lastly, I use wwiseutil-gui to replace the desired original audios with the new ones. Useful for game modding.

:: [Conversion Options]
:: Note that the single quotation mark after the set is intentational and should be kept.
:: See [?1] as for why.

:: Path to Wwise base directory. Simply modify the BASE variable (although we only care about the PATH one). (Uses the environment variables set with wwise installation.)
set "wwiseBASE=%WWISEROOT%
set "wwisePATH=%wwiseBASE%\Authoring\x64\Release\bin\WwiseConsole.exe

:: Path to ffmpeg, (blank = current directory / in path)
set "ffmpeg=

:: Path to 7zip, (blank = current directory / in path) (7zip is only required for automated installation)
set "7zPATH=

:: Audio frequency in Hz. (Do not include the unit, e.g. 8000, 24000, 48000) (blank means same as source)
set samplerate=

:: Audio channels, 1 is mono, 2 is stereo... (blank means same as source)
set channels=

:: Audio Volume, can enter a fraction (1.5 = 150%, 0.5 = 50%), or a decibel value (10dB, -5dB, increasing and decreasing respectively); (blank = no change)
set volume=

:: ffmpeg extra - extra parameters to include for ffmpeg to change your audio, example (loudnorm) to normalize volume. (blank = nothing)
set extra=

:: Conversion (case-sensitive name), specifies the conversion type and the quality affects the size and bitrate of the result. (High, Medium, Low)
set "conversion=Vorbis Quality High

set "project=wavtowemscript

:: Output directy, blank = current
set "out=

:: Whether to close the window when the conversion is done [true/false]
set CloseOnExit=true

set updates=true

:: Script version
set version=5
::----------------------------------------::

:: [Some examples of what some conversion options might look like]
:: set "ffmpeg=C:\Users\myuser\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe
:: set samplerate=48000
:: set volume=2.5
:: set channels=1
:: [End examples]

:: [?1] - Why the single quotation mark after the set, before the variable name?
:: Quotations marks aren't actually matched in batch scripts, instead, they are toggles.
:: Effectively, one quotation mark removes the need for the user to add quotation marks of their own, while also preserving special characters.
:: Also, it is standard to put the quotation mark before the variable name, so that it isn't actually included in the contents.
